# Bar Graph Generator

In a typical bar graph we have two values for the X an Y axis, the X axis representing the values in units in most cases being related to the Y axis and the Y axis often defining what objects have the values in the X axis.

in this tool You enter the values of the X and Y axis and all you have to do is hit the generate button.
